# I2OVOG--R2MVOG

Domain video files

The I2OVOG dataset is the indoor-to-outdoor domain pair. It is developed by splitting the VidSTG dataset into the indoor part and the outdoor part. The manual division results are in these files.

The R2MVOG is the real-to-movie domain pair dataset. It is developed by combining the VidSTG ( real life dataset ) and the HC-STVG ( movie dataset ).
